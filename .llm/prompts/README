# Usage

## Research

__Note: Designed for CoPilot extension in IntelliJ__

- Have no files open
- Start a fresh branch
- Select the `.llm/prompts/1.a Research.md` file and add to context
- Choose an agent - I recommend Claude Sonnet 4

Use the following prompt:

```
Read your instructions from `1.a Research.md`.

<Research question>

```

For example:

```
Read your instructions from `1.a Research.md`.

Please research how to create a new JDBC based Native Connectors plugin for MySQL.

You will find:
 - Existing JDBC legacy plugin for MySQL in `flyway-database/flyway-mysql`
 - Existing Native Connectors plugin for Oracle in `flyway-database/flyway-database-nc-oracle`
 - Existing Tests for Native Connectors Oracle in `flyway-database/flyway-database-nc-oracle-test`
 - Existing documentation for Oracle in `documentation/Reference/Database Driver Reference/Oracle Database.md`
 - Existing documentation for MySQL in `documentation/Reference/Database Driver Reference/MySQL.md`
 - Existing documentation for Native Connectors Oracle in `documentation/Reference/Database Driver Reference/Oracle Database/Oracle Database - Native Connectors.md`
 - The parent Maven pom in `pom.xml`
 - The reactor pom in `flyway-database/pom.xml`
 - The command line pom in `flyway-commandline/pom.xml`
 - The CI/CD configuration for legacy tests in `.github/workflows/zz-build-and-test-edition.yml` under the Job `medium-tests-mysql`

 ```

 - Be as detailed as you can.
 - If things go wrong - reset the branch, start again with better information in the prompt.

 ### Sub-agents

 You'll need to create a new chat in order to clear out the context. You can then use the same prompt as above except:
 - With the correct sub-agent prompt file
 - With the prompt from the checklist.md

 I recommend once a sub-agent has completed making a commit along with ticking off that agent in the checklist.

### 1.b Post sub-agents
